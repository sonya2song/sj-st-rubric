So in February, top academic leaders at the UW made a painful decision to cut the number of Washington students the school will admit this fall to its main Seattle campus and increase the number of nonresident students, who pay nearly three times as much in tuition and fees. <br><br>""When the decision was made, it was not a happy one,"" said Philip Ballinger, the UW's admissions director. ""There were real debates, and internal reluctance to the last minute.""<br><br>The UW has offered spots in fall 2011 to about 5,700 Washington students so far, hundreds fewer than last year. Many more nonresidents &#x2014; out-of-state and international students combined &#x2014; have been offered a spot for fall.<br><br>The decision is based squarely on economics: Nonresident students in effect subsidize the education of Washington residents, providing a much-needed boost in revenue at a time the UW could see its funding cut by $200 million over the next biennium.<br><br>The UW expects about 3,850 in-state students to eventually enroll, making up about 70 percent of the freshman class. Last year, they made up 73 percent.<br><br>Among the students rejected: Brandon Stover, a valedictorian at Chief Sealth High School, who has a 4.0 grade-point average.<br><br>""It was just a shock,"" Stover said. ""I don't know exactly what the UW is looking for.""<br><br>Stover, who wants to go to the UW's Foster School of Business, took a few rigorous International Baccalaureate classes at Sealth, but focused his efforts on the school's Academy of Finance because those classes most closely dovetailed with his goal to major in business administration.<br><br>Because the West Seattle resident needs to live at home and work to make ends meet, he did not apply to other colleges. He's appealing his rejection, but also is considering going to South Seattle Community College or UW-Bothell next fall, and then trying to transfer to the UW.<br><br>Signal to families<br><br>Edmonds-Woodway High School teacher Dave Quinn said the UW did a good job trying to signal to families that admission was going to be much, much harder this year. But not everyone took it to heart.<br><br>""There were certain families in our community that just counted on"" getting accepted, said Quinn, an instructor in the school's college-level International Baccalaureate (IB) program. Some students who didn't get in had taken a full slate of IB classes, with ""a GPA that sings, and 150 hours of community service"" &#x2014; natural candidates for admission in any other year.<br><br>""There are a number of families who are distraught about this,"" echoed Linda Jacobs, a private college counselor. ""They thought they were a shoo-in.""<br><br>For Ballinger, who has had to respond to the frustrations of countless families, the challenge has been explaining that if the UW didn't admit more out-of-state and international students, it would have had to cut the number of in-state students even more.<br><br>""People think they're taking the place of resident students; they're not,"" he said. ""They're subsidizing resident students ... . I don't think people understand that.""<br><br>""The culture of this place is public to the bone,"" he added. ""For us to be in a position where we have to cut back enrollment in Washington here, and take more students from out of state &#x2014; that is an ugly conversation.""<br><br>Elsewhere in the U.S., as state funding has shrunk, other flagship universities have aggressively courted out-of-state students to make up for lost revenue &#x2014; notably, the University of Oregon, where 47 percent of the school's freshmen were from out of state in 2010, and the University of Colorado, Boulder, where 43 percent of freshmen were from out of state.<br><br>Although the UW's numbers might suggest otherwise, nonresidents need a stronger academic record than in-state students to gain admission, Ballinger said.<br><br>Out-of-state students tend to have slightly lower GPAs, but that's because many come from top public and private schools where there's less grade inflation. And their SAT scores are usually higher.<br><br>International students often have math SAT scores that outpace all U.S. students &#x2014; scoring 700 points or more out of 800 &#x2014; and many get a perfect score.<br><br>""They're not alone""<br><br>Both Quinn and Jacobs, the private college counselor, say many families are failing to make the connection between state budget cuts and a lower admission rate.<br><br>""One of the most important things for our kids to hear is that they're not alone"" if they didn't get into the UW, Quinn said. Chances are, they didn't get in ""because of some decision somebody made in Olympia.""<br><br>While the numbers are still changing, so far this year about 56 percent of in-state applicants have been admitted, compared with 62 percent last year.<br><br>Although every public university in Washington is facing the same cutbacks, they are not all trimming their freshman class.<br><br>Washington State University boosted the number of in-state freshmen it admitted this year by about 13 percent, expecting to enroll about 400 more freshmen in fall 2011 than it did last year, said John Fraire, vice president of enrollment management. To make room, the school will have to stretch housing and classrooms, he said.<br><br>""Even in light of the crisis, we've made a commitment to grow instead of shrink,"" he said.<br><br>Ballinger said the UW did not make that choice because taking as many in-state students as it did last year while absorbing budget cutbacks would hurt the school's quality.<br><br>Western Washington University saw a decrease in the number of students who applied this year, perhaps because the school cut its recruitment efforts as a cost-saving measure. It expects to enroll fewer freshmen as a result.<br><br>Central Washington University expects fewer freshmen to enroll &#x2014; in part because tuition is going up &#x2014; and plans to recruit more out-of-state students next year.<br><br>Leaving the state<br><br>In Washington, more high-school graduates leave this state for college and other postsecondary study than come here from out-of-state as freshmen, said state Rep. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle.<br><br>That net out-migration, as it's termed, is the fifth-highest nationally among the states, and is a concern among policymakers, who fear the state's failure to grow its higher-education system will have long-term economic consequences.<br><br>One of the fixes to the state's higher-education financial problem is almost sure to be even higher tuition for resident students; indeed, some Washington parents whose children were denied admission to the UW have asked if they can pay out-of-state tuition to get their students in, Ballinger said. (The answer is no.)<br><br>Washington is one of the few states where the Legislature sets tuition, and how high it should go is a matter of debate. Tuition and fees for an in-state undergraduate at the UW Seattle campus run to $8,701 a year while a nonresident pays $25,329.<br><br>Carlyle is sponsoring a bill, HB 1795, that aims to change the funding equation. It would give the state's four-year schools unlimited tuition-setting authority for four years, encouraging them to set different prices on different degrees.<br><br>For example, the UW might charge more for an engineering degree than a history degree because engineering students must take many expensive lab classes and usually earn more when they graduate.<br><br>The bill would also raise the level at which a family becomes eligible for financial aid, helping more middle-class families qualify, Carlyle said.<br><br>Another bill, HB 1666, would give the state's four-year schools limited tuition-setting authority. The proposal would blunt the impact on lower- and middle-income families by creating a private financial-aid endowment.<br><br>Carlyle has heard from ""fantastically qualified kids from Ballard High School, with extraordinary grades, whose parents have paid taxes for decades, and can't get into the UW.<br><br>""It's just not right,"" he said.<br><br>Ballinger agreed.<br><br>""Right now, it just stings,"" he said ""There's no getting around it.""<br><br>Katherine Long: 206-464-2219 or <br><br>klong@seattletimes.com<br><br>","[{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":""A series of worsening revenue forecasts and a $5 billion state budget shortfall have made it even more likely that the Legislature will again slash higher-education funding this year.

She's held truancy workshops for groups of parents and picked students up from home herself. She even dropped off food at the home of one family, thinking the kids there weren't coming to class because they were hungry.<br><br>With many families, her efforts worked. One mom was so intent on fulfilling her attendance contract that she called the police when her son refused to go to school.<br><br>Still, when Bermes, who is in her first year as a school counselor, looked at the latest numbers, her hopes of a fast truancy turnaround were dashed. Attendance hasn't improved, and neither has the high rate of unexcused absences, five times greater than the district average.<br><br>Principal Vicki Sacco told Bermes not to worry. The kind of overhaul the West Seattle school undertook this year takes time. And a lot has changed for the better, too, as West Seattle labors through its first year as part of a large, federally funded effort to turn around some of the nation's lowest-performing schools.<br><br>Seven months into the school year, the two-story brick school in West Seattle's High Point neighborhood is a much calmer place, with fewer fights and stricter rules. Test scores are up, especially in math, where the school's overall improvement from last spring to this winter was greater than at any other elementary in the city.<br><br>The results impressed the district's central office so much that interim Superintendent Susan Enfield showed up recently with two sheet cakes to celebrate.<br><br>Still, it's clear that West Seattle is just getting started in its struggle to attain what is still a rare distinction: becoming a high-achieving, high-poverty school.<br><br>Despite the test-score improvements, many students have a long way to go before their academic skills are where they should be. Sacco is always trying to find the best balance for keeping up the pace of improvement she'd like to see without pushing teachers too hard. The teaching is strong, Sacco says, but there's room for improvement &#x2014; even as the extra money that the federal grant provides is undercut by district budget cuts.<br><br>And nothing the school does will help if students miss class too often.<br><br>""If the kids aren't here, it doesn't matter what you do, they're not learning,"" Sacco said. ""They need to be here.""<br><br>Only 40 to 45 of the school's 398 students make up the bulk of the absences, Bermes says, but that's still too many.<br><br>One kindergartner, she said, has missed 68 days &#x2014; more than one-third of the school year.<br><br>A national effort<br><br>Nationwide, more than 100 schools were awarded similar federal turnaround grants last year, including two other schools in Seattle and 15 elsewhere in the state. Additional schools will get funds this year.<br><br>Many have a lot in common with West Seattle Elementary, including a large percentage of students who qualify for free- or reduced-price lunches and are learning English. Many at West Seattle are from families that have immigrated from East Africa and Latin American countries.<br><br>To win one of the grants &#x2014; which add $350,000 to $400,000 to West Seattle Elementary's budget each year for three years &#x2014; school districts must agree to significant changes. At West Seattle, that's meant a new principal, many new teachers, 15 extra minutes of school each day, more after-school activities &#x2014; and much more accountability, for students and parents as well as staff.<br><br>The Seattle Times has been following West Seattle's efforts this school year to see what they yield.<br><br>Improving the school's climate has been the biggest success so far.<br><br>That was Sacco's first major effort as the school's new leader, and many parents and students say West Seattle feels like a different place.<br><br>""We're able to learn more. The rules are working,"" said fifth-grader Arlondra Rivera, whose test scores have shot up this year from average to above average.<br><br>Last year ""you could get away with anything,"" said another fifth-grader. ""Even if you beat someone up, you could go on field trips.""<br><br>This year, he missed one excursion for forgetting his permission slip. And because he got into some trouble and hadn't finished all his homework, he almost missed another.<br><br>There isn't enough money in the federal grant to significantly extend the school day, which many believe has been one key to major gains in achievement at other high-poverty schools. So Sacco and her staff look for ways to make sure every minute counts.<br><br>One big focus: making clear to students what's expected and rewarding them for achieving it. Each teacher, for example, has a stack of ""Husky Bucks"" to give students for working hard, for kindness, for doing the right thing. The more Bucks students earn, the better chance they have of receiving a prize in a Husky Buck drawing held every few months. There also are awards for classes that behave best in the cafeteria, and those with the highest attendance rates.<br><br>Teachers such as Clarissa Resendez, a veteran who is considered one of the school's best, have their own incentive programs, too.<br><br>Goals and awareness<br><br>Each month, Resendez, who came to West Seattle this year from nearby Highland Park Elementary, sends her fifth-graders home with a ""goal"" sheet outlining behavior and academic expectations that both the student and parents sign. She tells students if they're below grade level &#x2014; which are often tough conversations, she says, but effective in giving some students the push they need to try harder. And four or five times a day, she has the kids rate their own behavior.<br><br>It doesn't take long. She just runs through the class list, asking each student how many points they think they deserve.<br><br>There is no punishment for losing points &#x2014; except not getting invited to a short, extra recess or getting a small treat at the end of each month.

Finishing a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in fewer than four years means less time spent absorbing the rich intellectual environment of a college campus. Some  academics worry that a focus on career skills means shorting students on the type of    well-rounded education that allows people to adapt and grow as jobs change.<br><br>But equally worrisome is the rising cost of going to college. More than half of Washington&#x2019;s college students borrow money to pay for college, and in 2011, they graduated with an average debt of about $22,244, according to the Project on Student Debt. <br><br>Depending on the terms, a loan of that size would require 10  years of monthly payments ranging between $220 and $255 a month.<br><br>Joseph Nutting<br><br>Joseph Nutting&#x2019;s degree in business administration from Washington State University is every bit like the one students earn after spending four years in Pullman.<br><br>But Nutting didn&#x2019;t have to sell the business he&#x2019;d purchased with a partner &#x2014; a failing cafe that had started to turn around &#x2014; or move across the state to take classes.<br><br>Nutting, 26, completed his WSU degree entirely online, taking classes at night, on the weekends or anytime he could. The degree itself costs about the same as one earned on campus, but because Nutting could stay put in Vancouver, &#x201C;the cost savings is just amazing,&#x201D; he said. <br><br>The school began offering a four-year degree online several years ago, and now has nearly 2,000 in-state students. It formed the Global Campus last summer to replicate a campuslike experience online, said David Cillay, vice president of online learning for WSU.<br><br>The Global Campus has its own student government and will hold an online-career fair and an academic showcase this year so students can show off their work to faculty and experts in the community &#x2014; just as they would be able to do on campus.<br><br>Some worry that online classes aren&#x2019;t rigorous enough, and that students may miss out on mentoring, networking, friendships and the other intangibles of college life.<br><br>Nutting doesn&#x2019;t see it that way. Because he had to be self-motivated, earning a degree online &#x201C;was probably one of the more difficult things I&#x2019;ve done in my life,&#x201D; he said. And he believes WSU has done a good job of creating a virtual campus that gives students ways to get to know each other and their professors.<br><br>In his senior year, he was elected president of the Global Campus&#x2019;s student government.<br><br>Heather Shute<br><br>Can technical training from a community college earn you a higher wage than a bachelor&#x2019;s degree? Absolutely.<br><br>Two years ago, Heather Shute swapped her keyboard for a mechanic&#x2019;s hand tools and began working on a license in aircraft maintenance at South Seattle Community College. <br><br>Shute already had her bachelor&#x2019;s from Pacific Lutheran University and seven years of work experience in print and broadcast journalism, but she was worried about low pay in her profession. &#x201C;With the changing economy, I wanted a highly technical skill in my back pocket,&#x201D; she said.<br><br>For Shute, who is 32, going back to college was not easy. She started classes at 7 a.m., then went to work in the afternoon, studying over her lunch hour and at odd moments of the day.<br><br>But because she had some money saved and also earned scholarships, Shute will finish the $15,000 program this spring debt-free. A mechanic with her licenses can earn between $45,000 and $80,000 a year, and her bachelor&#x2019;s degree may help her gain a toehold in management.<br><br>And she already has a job &#x2014; as a modification mechanic working for Boeing.<br><br>Shute has no regrets about leaving newsrooms for an airplane hangar. &#x201C;Tinkering in the garage has always been a joy,&#x201D; said Shute, who grew up going to air shows with her dad and helping him on experimental aircraft they built together.<br><br>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m mentally challenged,&#x201D; said Shute. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m physically challenged.

Finishing a bachelor•À_s degree in fewer than four years means less time spent absorbing the rich intellectual environment of a college campus.

What sets the Dream Project apart is that it has a ""complexity and theory of action"" that makes it more effective. Its students are sophisticated, well-trained and unusually committed, he said.<br><br>Renton High principal Damien Pattenaude agreed. ""The Dream Project itself is not a silver bullet,"" he said. Rather, it's the strength of the mentors and their relationships with the students at Renton High, where 65 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.<br><br>Renton is one of two schools where the whole senior class is being mentored; the other school is the Tyee Educational Complex, three small schools on one campus in the Highline School District.<br><br>Senior Fabian Del Toro is one of the mentees at Renton High.

As part of the Dream Project, UW students take a general-studies class for credit that delves into social justice, empowerment and the relationship between the two.<br><br>""If we believe that a university is where society's leaders &#x2014; policymakers, educators, and businessmen and women &#x2014; are fostered and developed, then we have a duty to ensure they do not graduate blind to the struggles of individuals whose lives are different from their own,"" Asfaw said by email from Ethiopia, where he was visiting family members in December. He is now doing postgraduate work at the University of Cambridge in England.<br><br>Asfaw said he's pleased, but not surprised, by how much the program has grown. He called it ""a validation of our early conviction that students who have the grades and the desire to attend college only need a little guidance and support to make a successful transition to the next level.""<br><br>The program targets high-school students starting in the spring of their junior year. The UW students go to high schools every week for an hour and help younger students figure out if they're on track with a transcript that fulfills college requirements.

""It's student-centered. The reason faculty members are seeking it out is that it supports student learning and engagement.""<br><br>Recording lectures<br><br>A Thanksgiving snowstorm that paralyzed traffic two years ago prompted Guy Hamilton, who heads the biotechnology program at Shoreline Community College, to try new software that allowed him to record lectures and post them online. He set up his MacBook in the basement and began lecturing to his computer.<br><br>""The students just loved it,"" he said, especially because they could watch lectures on difficult topics over and over. When Hamilton graded the final exams, he found his students had done 15 to 20 percent better than expected.<br><br>That was the end of live lectures for Hamilton, who now records all of his lectures and spends class time on group discussions and problem-solving. ""I won't do it any other way now,"" he said.<br><br>Most of Hamilton's students are working adults who already hold four-year degrees. They can play a recorded lecture anytime, even while commuting on the bus. And Hamilton can monitor which students watched the assigned lecture, and which did not.<br><br>Among the state's technical and community colleges in the Puget Sound area, Shoreline is the heaviest user of the software that allows faculty to record lectures.<br><br>Many weren't even aware that ""flipping the classroom"" is an educational trend; they're just doing it because it makes sense, said Ann Garnsey-Harter, director of Shoreline's virtual college and e-learning support services. Students like recorded lectures because ""you can go back and listen again to what was said &#x2014; you can go back as many times as you want,"" she said.<br><br>Online innovations<br><br>Steven Emory couldn't imagine teaching chemistry without a chemistry lab, but a few years ago budget constraints at Western Washington University made that likely.<br><br>So Emory, an associate professor of chemistry and director of the Advanced Materials Science &amp; Engineering Center, began looking for ways to do some of the labs virtually.<br><br>He and his colleagues identified four labs that could be done on a computer because ""they're really just mixing stuff in a beaker; there's not much to that in terms of chemistry."" And little extras could be embedded into the labs &#x2014; for example, animations that showed how molecules were interacting during an electrical conductivity experiment. Students could linger over a lab as long as they wanted &#x2014; or complete it in two hours.<br><br>Emory and his colleagues were able to convert half the labs into virtual labs, saving the school money. He's cautiously optimistic about the educational benefits: ""At least, at this point, we didn't do any harm, and there appears to be areas where we might have had gains,"" he said.<br><br>Computer-delivered class time has also helped solve budget constraints at Washington State University, which has doubled the size of a speech class many students take to satisfy a core requirement, said lecturer Mark Wadleigh, who works in the Murrow College of Communication.<br><br>More than 1,500 WSU freshmen signed up for the class, but the school's largest lecture hall seated only 500. Along with revamping the course to make it more relevant to today's communication demands, WSU made attending lectures in-person optional, Wadleigh said &#x2014; students could go to the lecture hall or watch online. Other innovations included online quizzes and a requirement that students deliver their speeches over a computer.<br><br>""I think the students are getting a higher-quality education that's more interesting, more relevant,"" Wadleigh said.<br><br>Student engagement<br><br>A cognitive scientist will tell you that not even the biggest brains on the planet can juggle seven to 10 things in their heads at once, UW lecturer Freeman says.<br><br>His 50-minute-long lectures in biology, four days a week to 500 students in Kane Hall, demanded that kind of juggling act. So he began revising his class to make it more digestible and give students more opportunities to practice.<br><br>He developed an online multiple-choice quiz to go along with each reading assignment and ""we get 90 to 95 percent participation every night,"" he said. ""They stay on task. They get a ton more out of class.""<br><br>Freeman was one of the first at the UW to adopt the use of clickers &#x2014; handheld wireless devices that allow students to answer a multiple-choice question posted on the screen during class, giving Freeman instant feedback on how many grasp the concept.<br><br>During class, Freeman also asks students to turn to their neighbors and discuss the rationale for their answers. He goes down the class roll, calling on individual students and asking them questions.<br><br>""Honestly, Biology 180 was a refreshing change from all the classes I have been taking at UW,"" said freshman Mustufa Jafry, majoring in biochemistry and chemistry. ""I not only learn a lot more in this class, but I actually am able to retain a lot of it even after the exam.""<br><br>As for that dismal failure rate of 17 percent, Freeman says fewer than 4 percent of his students flunk the class today. About 24 percent earn an A, compared with 14 percent before he switched his methods.

Finishing a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in fewer than four years means less time spent absorbing the rich intellectual environment of a college campus. Some  academics worry that a focus on career skills means shorting students on the type of    well-rounded education that allows people to adapt and grow as jobs change.<br><br>But equally worrisome is the rising cost of going to college. More than half of Washington&#x2019;s college students borrow money to pay for college, and in 2011, they graduated with an average debt of about $22,244, according to the Project on Student Debt. <br><br>Depending on the terms, a loan of that size would require 10  years of monthly payments ranging between $220 and $255 a month.<br><br>Joseph Nutting<br><br>Joseph Nutting&#x2019;s degree in business administration from Washington State University is every bit like the one students earn after spending four years in Pullman.<br><br>But Nutting didn&#x2019;t have to sell the business he&#x2019;d purchased with a partner &#x2014; a failing cafe that had started to turn around &#x2014; or move across the state to take classes.<br><br>Nutting, 26, completed his WSU degree entirely online, taking classes at night, on the weekends or anytime he could. The degree itself costs about the same as one earned on campus, but because Nutting could stay put in Vancouver, &#x201C;the cost savings is just amazing,&#x201D; he said. <br><br>The school began offering a four-year degree online several years ago, and now has nearly 2,000 in-state students. It formed the Global Campus last summer to replicate a campuslike experience online, said David Cillay, vice president of online learning for WSU.<br><br>The Global Campus has its own student government and will hold an online-career fair and an academic showcase this year so students can show off their work to faculty and experts in the community &#x2014; just as they would be able to do on campus.<br><br>Some worry that online classes aren&#x2019;t rigorous enough, and that students may miss out on mentoring, networking, friendships and the other intangibles of college life.<br><br>Nutting doesn&#x2019;t see it that way. Because he had to be self-motivated, earning a degree online &#x201C;was probably one of the more difficult things I&#x2019;ve done in my life,&#x201D; he said. And he believes WSU has done a good job of creating a virtual campus that gives students ways to get to know each other and their professors.<br><br>In his senior year, he was elected president of the Global Campus&#x2019;s student government.<br><br>Heather Shute<br><br>Can technical training from a community college earn you a higher wage than a bachelor&#x2019;s degree? Absolutely.<br><br>Two years ago, Heather Shute swapped her keyboard for a mechanic&#x2019;s hand tools and began working on a license in aircraft maintenance at South Seattle Community College. <br><br>Shute already had her bachelor&#x2019;s from Pacific Lutheran University and seven years of work experience in print and broadcast journalism, but she was worried about low pay in her profession. &#x201C;With the changing economy, I wanted a highly technical skill in my back pocket,&#x201D; she said.<br><br>For Shute, who is 32, going back to college was not easy. She started classes at 7 a.m., then went to work in the afternoon, studying over her lunch hour and at odd moments of the day.<br><br>But because she had some money saved and also earned scholarships, Shute will finish the $15,000 program this spring debt-free. A mechanic with her licenses can earn between $45,000 and $80,000 a year, and her bachelor&#x2019;s degree may help her gain a toehold in management.<br><br>And she already has a job &#x2014; as a modification mechanic working for Boeing.<br><br>Shute has no regrets about leaving newsrooms for an airplane hangar. &#x201C;Tinkering in the garage has always been a joy,&#x201D; said Shute, who grew up going to air shows with her dad and helping him on experimental aircraft they built together.<br><br>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m mentally challenged,&#x201D; said Shute. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m physically challenged.

And she enjoyed the community college better than high school.<br><br>&#x201C;I had good class sizes, and really good professors,&#x201C; Weiss said. <br><br>She&#x2019;s working in Olympia full time this quarter as a government-relations director for the Associated Students of UW, the student-government organization, and is on track to graduate this spring or summer. <br><br>She doesn&#x2019;t think Running Start is for everyone. Many students prefer the more structured world of high school, and not everybody is mature enough to enter college full time at 16.<br><br>And there were frustrations: Credits from a quarter of the classes she took at North Seattle CC didn&#x2019;t transfer to the UW.<br><br>But with help from her parents and   state and federal student aid, she will graduate not just early but debt-free.<br><br>Elaine Melnik<br><br>Like Weiss, Elaine Melnik used a dual-credit strategy to get a jump-start on college.<br><br>She spent her junior and senior years of high school at the public Lake Washington Institute of Technology in Kirkland, in a free program similar to Running Start that allowed her to graduate at 18 with both her high-school diploma and an associate degree.<br><br>Then she took advantage of another program &#x2014; a new one offered by Central Washington University that allowed her to apply her earlier technical classes toward a bachelor&#x2019;s degree.<br><br>In 2011, CWU started the bachelor&#x2019;s in information technology and administrative-management program, which accepts up to 105 credits of technical courses earned at community or technical colleges. <br><br>Students in the CWU program take all of the general education classes they missed while working on a technical degree, including literature and the humanities, philosophy and science. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s kind of like an upside-down degree,&#x201D; said Laurie Stehle, director of online programs for CWU. <br><br>In about eight quarters, or two full years, transfer students can earn a bachelor&#x2019;s for about $24,000. The classes can be taken entirely online.<br><br>Melnik also worked full time while in school and was able to pay for the degree without taking out any loans.<br><br>Daron Vchulek<br><br>Daron Vchulek was in his 40s, working in radiation technology, when he went back to school to get a bachelor&#x2019;s degree &#x2014; at a community college.<br><br>In 2007, Bellevue College was one of a handful of community colleges in the state that began offering bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in specific fields, called applied bachelor&#x2019;s degrees.<br><br>For Vchulek, there was a compelling reason to choose Bellevue College: &#x201C;It was close to half the cost,&#x201D; he said. <br><br>Once he finished, Vchulek was accepted to the MBA program at the UW, where he&#x2019;s studying now. He also parlayed his education into a career advancement &#x2014; he&#x2019;s now vice president of ancillary services at The Polyclinic in Seattle.<br><br>Eight community and technical colleges now <br><br>offer one or more applied degrees<br><br>, and others are on the way.<br><br>The programs offer specific skills, but they can lead to high-paying jobs with high employment rates. For example, students who received a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in diagnostic ultrasound from Bellevue College have a 93 percent employment rate, and make an average of $65,000, according to a state salary and employment survey.<br><br>Vchulek said he also liked going to Bellevue College because the campus was smaller, parking was easy and he became good friends with his classmates. <br><br>&#x201C;At the UW, I don&#x2019;t get to know them very well at all,&#x201D; he said.<br><br>Sadia Anees<br><br>About 40 percent of bachelor&#x2019;s degree graduates in Washington start their college careers at a community or technical college, where tuition and fees are about a third the cost of tuition at the UW.<br><br>Sadia Anees is one of them. The Lake Washington High School graduate was accepted to several four-year schools, but Bellevue College was a relative bargain. <br><br>Anees earned a high grade-point average and began to peruse lists of scholarships as her second year ended. To her surprise, she found a lot of scholarship money available for community-college students who wanted to transfer to private, four-year schools.<br><br>She is now at Loyola University in Chicago, a   private school where tuition and living expenses are more than $50,000 a year.<br><br>&#x201C;I saw a lot of opportunities for out-of-state students,&#x201D; Anees said of the scholarships. &#x201C;After the scholarship and financial aid, it was cheaper for me to go out-of-state to attend a four-year than to go to an in-state public.&#x201D;<br><br>Katherine Long: 206-464-2219 or klong@seattletimes.com.<br><br>On Twitter: @katherinelong.<br><br>","[{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":""But equally worrisome is the rising cost of going to college.

Duncan said the Oakland agreement could serve as a model for other districts.<br><br>In Seattle, efforts to address its long-standing disproportionate-discipline problem have gathered steam then faded as superintendents have come and gone, funding has been granted and then run out, promising programs have been started and scrapped.<br><br>&#x201C;The district has had committee after committee, report after report, and it&#x2019;s kind of like a little progress and then a stall, a little bit of progress,&#x201D; said Julie Nelson, director of the city of    Seattle&#x2019;s Office for Civil Rights.<br><br>&#x201C;If you look at the data over time, we haven&#x2019;t made a dent in it.&#x201D;<br><br>Nelson continues to serve on school-district committees and other groups studying the problem in the hope that this time, the outcome will be different.<br><br>Biggest disparities<br><br>In Seattle, some of the biggest disparities show up in schools with relatively small numbers of black students. <br><br>For example, in the 2009-10 school year &#x2014; the latest year for which data were available &#x2014; 21 percent of all African-American students at Nathan Hale High School were disciplined, compared to only 4.8 percent of all other students.<br><br>That same year, Rainier Beach High, which has a higher percentage of black students, had a smaller discipline gap, but still suspended more than 19 percent of its African-American students. <br><br>Rainier Beach PTSA President Rita Green has heard countless stories of black students who received harsher punishments than white students for infractions that seemed identical.<br><br>Green, who is African-American, said she believes &#x201C;a lot of culturally incompetent teachers are put in classrooms teaching diverse students, and they don&#x2019;t have any experience, and they don&#x2019;t respect them.&#x201D;<br><br>In the 2007-09 school years, when Green&#x2019;s son was at Mercer Middle School, she and other parents pored through suspension data and came up with a list of five teachers who were far more likely than their peers to refer black students to the office for discipline.<br><br>Green said that after the parents showed the teacher data to the principal, the suspension numbers for black students started to go down, but were still higher than for other races. <br><br>The overall racial disparity in Seattle schools is similar to what a privately funded study has found in Washington.<br><br>&#x201C;Reclaiming Students,&#x201D; a 2012 study by Washington Appleseed and TeamChild, found that suspensions and expulsions hurt all children but are hardest on low-income and minority students, who are half as likely as white students to continue studying online, through homework or in other ways.<br><br>Appleseed    and TeamChild recommended drastically reducing out-of-school suspensions &#x2014; a position that is finding growing favor among educators. <br><br>Susan Enfield, the former Seattle Schools superintendent who now runs the Highline School District, has set a goal of ending out-of-school suspensions there by 2015.<br><br>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re developing alternatives to keeping kids out of school because we know if kids are out of school, they can&#x2019;t learn, and you can start a kid spiraling down a path they can&#x2019;t get out of,&#x201D; said Highline spokeswoman Catherine Carbone Rogers.<br><br>Reasons for gap<br><br>Reasons for the discipline gap and the academic-achievement gap overlap: poverty, inequality, racism, a lack of diversity among the teaching staff and a failure to understand different cultures. <br><br>Suspensions almost surely exacerbate the achievement gap.<br><br>&#x201C;I think much of the underlying issue is poverty, as well as single-parent households,&#x201D; said Seattle School Board member Michael DeBell. He said students who live in poorer households tend to receive more disciplinary actions &#x2014; perhaps because the long hours of the working poor leave them less time to get involved in their children&#x2019;s education.<br><br>Principals who zealously enforce every infraction end up suspending more students, DeBell said, &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re more willing to take each case over its own circumstances, have a more flexible attitude, you&#x2019;ll have fewer cases.&#x201D; <br><br>Bernardo Ruiz, Seattle Public Schools&#x2019; equity and race director, said it is preposterous to suggest children and their families are to blame for disproportionate discipline.<br><br>Ruiz said a white teacher untrained in cultural differences could get into an unnecessary confrontation by saying to a black student who enters the classroom after the bell: &#x201C;Thank you for coming, you&#x2019;ve graced us with your presence.&#x201D;<br><br>Linda Mangel, education equity director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington state, said studies show little racial disparity in discipline for &#x201C;objective&#x201D; infractions such as fighting or bringing a gun to school.<br><br>&#x201C;Where the racial disparity kicks in, all the discipline data says, is when you look at the subjective reasons for discipline, things like disrespect or being disruptive, excessive noise, loitering,&#x201D; Mangel said.<br><br>Weak teachers are more likely to lose control of a class and send students to the office for discipline, said Phil Brockman, executive director of K-12 operations and a former principal. He believes part of the solution should include better teacher training and hiring a more diverse staff.    &#x201C;To me, personally, it&#x2019;s the relationships,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We need to have teachers who know and understand, who have cultural competency, treating students with dignity and respect. When they know you care, they respond.&#x201D;<br><br>Personal touch<br><br>That personal touch is something Gloria Briggs felt was lacking at Garfield but said her son found at Cleveland, where he transferred after the Garfield incident. <br><br>When Troy was accused of possessing a dangerous weapon at Garfield, she said, an administrator inaccurately wrote that he had been the one who brought the device to school. Briggs said the administrator made matters worse in a disciplinary meeting by saying, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve had problems with Troy before,&#x201D; apparently confusing him with another student.<br><br>A review of Troy&#x2019;s file showed he had never been referred to the principal&#x2019;s office or otherwise disciplined, Briggs said.<br><br>&#x201C;Just think if I was a parent who didn&#x2019;t know what to do, who didn&#x2019;t know I had the right to appeal the suspension,&#x201D; Briggs said. &#x201C;My child would have been ruined; he would have failed all his courses that semester; he would have had on his record being in possession of a dangerous weapon.&#x201D;<br><br>Briggs believes the academic success of black students depends, in part, on seeing teachers of their own race.<br><br>On that front, the district has also struggled.<br><br>Jonathan Knapp, president of the Seattle Education Association, said he was disappointed the district wasn&#x2019;t doing more to recruit black teachers, pushed it to try harder, and was pleased to join a recruiting effort at the National Alliance of Black School Educators conference in Nashville last fall. <br><br>A training effort a decade ago, Courageous Conversations on Race, helped teachers understand and work with students of other cultures, Knapp said, but, with a change in superintendents, &#x201C;it just kind of went away.&#x201D;<br><br>After news broke last week that the Department of Education is studying discipline in Seattle, Superintendent Jos&#xE9; Banda acknowledged the problem and said he will work with the federal government to find solutions.<br><br>Already, Cleveland High is developing a &#x201C;restorative justice&#x201D; program in which people in conflict negotiate appropriate punishment and how to make any victim whole.<br><br>The district also recently set up two committees to study discipline and racial fairness, one called Equity and Race, the other, Positive Climate and Discipline.<br><br>Pat Sander, liaison to the second committee, said Aki Kurose Middle School Academy and Broadview-Thompson K-8 School are building programs intended to make misconduct and discipline less frequent.<br><br>Neighboring districts are making similar efforts, and Oakland has agreed to institute a variety of programs for restorative justice, improved school climate and support for African-American male students.  <br><br>Oakland also has committed to avoid suspensions or expulsions as much as possible; to work with experts to curb discriminatory discipline; give more help to at-risk students; improve staff training; revise discipline policies; and survey students, staff members and families each year.<br><br>Oakland spokesman Troy Flint said the district was already focused on raising achievement for African-American males, who were struggling academically.<br><br>&#x201C;When students fall behind, they become frustrated and lash out ... and this is an underlying part of discipline problems,&#x201D; Flint said. <br><br>Some of the policies have not yet been fully put in place, and it will be another year before Oakland will be able to crunch the numbers and find out if its efforts are working. <br><br>Whatever steps schools take, parents must play a role as well, said Green, the Rainier Beach parent.<br><br>She encourages parents to become involved in their child&#x2019;s education, she said, so that &#x201C;you&#x2019;re holding the child accountable, as well as the teacher accountable.&#x201D;<br><br>&#x201C;As a parent, we can file lawsuits and testify at School Board meetings, and one day things may change,&#x201D; Green said. &#x201C;But the fastest way to change things is for you, as a parent, to be engaged.&#x201D;<br><br>This report includes archived material from The New York Times.

The hallways ring with verses from college fight songs, and classrooms are festooned with more pennants than a university dorm room.<br><br>If it seems like they're starting early, consider: In South King County, only about 54 percent of high-school graduates enroll in college or some form of postsecondary education.<br><br>So the educators at Scenic Hill, where 90 percent of the students are on free- and reduced-price lunch, want children to think about college from the moment they start elementary school, to inspire them to take their education as far as they can.<br><br>It's part of a larger, regionwide effort in South King County schools to get students to take rigorous classes, sign up for financial-aid and college-scholarship programs, and make plans to continue their education after they graduate.<br><br>The region's low college-going rate is not an outlier &#x2014; it's true throughout Washington. But the efforts by these districts to get students to go to college is unusual.<br><br>The alternative? Kent Superintendent Edward Lee Vargas puts it in these terms:<br><br>""I believe a high-school diploma by itself, without some kind of advanced training, is the pathway to poverty.""<br><br>Partnership formed<br><br>If the number of South King County students who enroll in college is low, the number of students who complete college is worse: Only about a quarter earn a two- or four-year college degree, or career credential.<br><br>For black, Hispanic and Native American students in South King County, the number is lower still &#x2014; about 11 percent.<br><br>Some of those students will eventually make it to college, or some form of vocational training, in their 20s or 30s. But the intervening years often represent a decade lost to low-wage jobs.<br><br>Two years ago, seven school districts formed the Community Center for Education Results (CCER) &#x2014; a partnership of area schools &#x2014; to address the region's failure to send kids to college.<br><br>Each district is grappling with the problem in its own way.<br><br>Kent offers free, full-day kindergarten to every student. And as a gesture to the importance of higher education, every kindergartner takes a field trip to a local four-year or community college.<br><br>Scenic Hill Elementary has taken the college connection one step further, inspired by the work of California educator Damen Lopez and his ""No Excuses University,"" a book and project that encourages all students to aim for college. Every classroom has adopted a college, and students and teachers wear that school's colors once a week.<br><br>The school also offers a ""parent university,"" offering parents basic math, English language and technology classes. That gives teachers an opportunity to talk to parents about sending their kids to college, too.<br><br>""After high school comes college,"" said Principal Dani Pfeiffer, echoing the theme of the project. ""No exceptions, no excuses.""<br><br>It's too early to know how successful it will be; Scenic Hill only adopted the strategy two years ago, and its students won't be applying for college for years.<br><br>But skip across the city to Kent-Meridian High School, where Principal Wade Barringer is starting to see change. In 2007, when Barringer became principal at Kent-Meridian, just 35 percent of the school's graduates went on to some kind of postsecondary training. Last year, it was 60 percent.<br><br>What has made the difference? ""We're trying to get kids to believe in themselves,"" Barringer said.<br><br>He doesn't look like a touchy-feely guy. He's got the solid build of a college athlete and the tough demeanor of a coach (in fact, he was both &#x2014; he threw the discus and javelin for the Washington State University track team, and later coached several high-school sports).<br><br>But along with increasing the rigor of high-school classes, and being tough and demanding on his students, Barringer also thinks a key part of his job is inspiration. Sixty-six percent of his students come from broken homes, and ""we might be the only adults who give them that care and attention,"" he said.<br><br>Support system<br><br>Helping students believe they are capable of good work, and creating a school system that supports them as they do that work, is a cornerstone of all the best education models &#x2014; ""whether you use the terms 'believe in kids' or 'you have to have high expectations for all students,' "" said Mary Jean Ryan, executive director of CCER.<br><br>Kent-Meridian offers the rigorous, college-level International Baccalaureate program, and the number of students participating is climbing. Students who enroll in IB have the option to take end-of-course exams for possible college credit, and the number of students who take those exams is viewed as a signal of how hard they worked and how seriously they took the subjects.<br><br>In 2007, students took 104 IB exams; last year, they took 249 exams. Thirty percent of juniors, and 27 percent of seniors, took at least one IB class in 2011.<br><br>And this year, Kent-Meridian is enlisting extra help from University of Washington students, who are holding regular, five-day-a-week office hours in the school as part of an intensive mentorship program, the Dream Project. The mentors help prep high-schoolers on the SAT or ACT college-entrance exams, then help them fill out college applications and apply for public and private scholarship money.<br><br>Kent uses a wide range of other methods to boost student achievement, including interventions when students fall behind. It has boosted the number of teachers certified to teach English Language Learners by offering in-house training. It is tackling the digital divide by giving every student in grades 7 through 10 a laptop computer, funded through a tech levy that passed in 2010.<br><br>It is installing 10 computer kiosks in community centers, banks and apartment buildings, loading them up with district materials translated into multiple languages, then using those same kiosks to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal so students can use their laptops to log on.<br><br>The district has paid for the programs by leveraging partnerships with community groups. And it has cut some programs to support others, such as full-day kindergarten.<br><br>On a regional scale, CCER has seized upon a 5-year-old state program, College Bound, that promises to pay public-school tuition for low-income students who stay out of trouble and graduate with a C average. Last year, nearly 90 percent of eligible eighth-graders signed up in the seven districts &#x2014; more than 5,000 students.<br><br>CCER also plans to sponsor events all year to help students apply for college and financial aid. And it's looking at ways to encourage students to take more demanding courses throughout high school, including four years of math, Ryan said.<br><br>The work is urgent, she said, because a recent Georgetown University study projected that by 2018, 67 percent of the state's job openings will require postsecondary training.<br><br>Diversity on display<br><br>The South King County districts covered by CCER are Kent, Auburn, Federal Way, Highline, Renton, Tukwila and the southern portion of the Seattle School District. They are a study in diversity: 60 percent of students are minorities, 54 percent are low-income, 17 percent speak a language other than English at home (167 different languages, to be exact).<br><br>In between classes at Kent-Meridian, the hallways are rich with the sounds of foreign tongues: Spanish, Russian, Vietnamese, Somali, Punjabi. There are girls wearing hijabs, boys wearing turbans.<br><br>Barringer says his students wear a tough exterior that belies their vulnerability. Some students are working, holding down jobs to support their families. They may have the academic chops to do well at a four-year university, but even those who are qualified often choose to stay closer to home, going to community college and working part time.<br><br>Elisa Aguayo, a graduate of Kent-Meridian High, is a junior at the UW and a member of the UW's Dream Project. She is the first in her family to go to college.<br><br>""I loved school growing up,"" Aguayo said. But her friends? ""My friends would say they weren't going to college because it wasn't in their plans,"" she said. ""As much as I tried to tell them they could change (plans), they'd rather work than get an education.""<br><br>That's why Pfeiffer, the Scenic Hill principal, wants to instill in her young students &#x2014; and their parents &#x2014; the idea that college is at the end of every path after high school. She believes it is the way out of poverty.<br><br>""Regardless of the challenges,"" she said, ""we want to make them dream of college as a possibility.""<br><br>Katherine Long: 206-464-2219 or <br><br>klong@seattletimes.com<br><br>.<br><br>On Twitter @katherinelong.<br><br>","[{""tag"":""solution"",""text"":""It's part of a larger, regionwide effort in South King County schools to get students to take rigorous classes, sign up for financial-aid and college-scholarship programs, and make plans to continue their education after they graduate.""},{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":""If it seems like they're starting early, consider: In South King County, only about 54 percent of high-school graduates enroll in college or some form of postsecondary education.""},{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":""If the number of South King County students who enroll in college is low, the number of students who complete college is worse: Only about a quarter earn a two- or four-year college degree, or career credential.""},{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":""For black, Hispanic and Native American students in South King County, the number is lower still •À_ about 11 percent""},{""tag"":""solution"",""text"":""Kent offers free, full-day kindergarten to every student.

The Superintendent of Public Instruction puts the state&#x2019;s extended graduation rate at 79.2 percent, so when dropouts are included, the class of 2009 would have been about 79,000 students.<br><br>The ERDC found that 20,774 of those graduates went to a community college or technical program, and 18,763 went to a four-year university, the vast majority staying in-state.<br><br>Completion rates for students at four-year schools were calculated using data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which reports that 68.8 percent of students at Washington&#x2019;s four-year schools complete college within six years. Nationally, the figure is 57.4 percent. For students who went out-of-state, however, the percentage of students that completed college could be higher, since some of the state&#x2019;s strongest academic performers go out of state.<br><br>Completion rates for students at Washington&#x2019;s community and technical colleges were calculated using data from the State Board of Community and Technical Colleges. In the fall quarter of 2007 &#x2014; the most recent data available &#x2014; 74 percent of students who entered a community or technical college directly from high school intended to transfer to a four-year college or university.<br><br>Of those students, 41 percent transferred or completed an associate degree within four years. Of the students who earned an associate degree, more than half transferred to another institution for additional schooling.<br><br>The number of students from the class of 2009 who are expected to earn a college degree would likely be higher if students from private high schools were included. However, the ERDC does not track private-school students. According to the NCES, about 4,600 students graduate from private high schools in Washington each year, or about 7 percent of all graduates.<br><br>","[{""tag"":""problem"",""text"":""We rank among the bottom states for the rate of high-school graduates who go on to college.

Her black cap and gown, with its red Stanford sash, hang on a wall inside, not far from where she's stapled a red-and-white Stanford pennant.<br><br>It's a little over the top, much like Chrissie Coxon herself, a confident, committed 25-year-old who is cheery but strict, and focuses on building her students' character as well as their academic skill.<br><br>The main purpose of the Stanford display is to put a name and a place to the concept of college &#x2014; one of the many ways Coxon is trying to inspire her kids at West Seattle Elementary to dream big.<br><br>She is one of 12 new teachers who came to West Seattle this fall to take part in a $3.5 billion, national push to shake up schools where test scores have been in the basement for years.<br><br>Located in Seattle's High Point neighborhood, the school is one of three in the city, 18 in the state and hundreds more around the nation that won large federal grants aimed at helping them make dramatic improvement over the next three years.<br><br>The program is among a number of Obama administration education initiatives based on the premise that, with the right attitude, the right incentives and the right kind of support, many struggling schools can make far greater gains than they have in the past.<br><br>Some critics disagree with that mindset, saying it overlooks the fact that schools can't fully overcome bigger forces such as poverty in the lives of students. But the Obama administration is charging ahead.<br><br>Districts had to agree to try to turn their schools around in one of four ways, ranging from closing their doors and starting over, to taking a path called ""transformation,"" the option that's in place at the three Seattle schools and many others across the nation. It's largely an improve-what's-there approach.<br><br>West Seattle Elementary is slated to receive about $1.2 million over the next three years. That's not enough to add hours onto the school day &#x2014; one hallmark of low-income schools nationally where test scores are high. But West Seattle students did start nearly a week early this fall, and are spending 15 minutes more in class each day.<br><br>The grant also has brought a new principal (required if the existing leader has worked there more than two years), a new approach to teaching reading, new after-school activities and much more training for teachers.<br><br>There's more support for parents, too, including sessions on how to prepare for teacher conferences and help their children at home.<br><br>The stakes are high for everyone. Teachers whose job evaluations are substandard, or whose students' scores don't improve over the next two years, will be placed in another school. Principal Vicki Sacco's job is on the line, too.<br><br>Sacco and the teachers have agreed to let The Seattle Times track what happens this year as they work to reinvent and refine much of what they do.<br><br>So far, teachers &#x2014; old and new &#x2014; are confident they will make progress this year. At the same time, many are anxious about all the changes. There is no script to follow for any of the schools that received the grants. Many teachers have been working 12-plus-hour days and on weekends, and just nine weeks into the school year, some already are worrying about burnout.<br><br>""There is a sense of pressure, and there's a sense of urgency,"" says Sacco. ""But everyone knew what they were getting into ... to a certain degree.""<br><br>""Use every minute""<br><br>Coxon says her class here has more immigrants than at her two previous schools on the East Coast, but just as many of the kids are poor.<br><br>She's confident she can help them do better because she did that at the other two schools.<br><br>In her first two years of teaching at a public school in the Bronx, she said, her students' reading level went up by an average of two grade levels, and they mastered nearly all of New York's math standards. She had similar success the following year at a charter school in New Jersey.<br><br>Coxon became a teacher through Teach for America, a national program that recruits young college graduates into teaching. The program may be coming to the Seattle area soon.<br><br>Her teaching approach and philosophy reflect what she learned in both those places, plus what she's picked up from observing accomplished teachers.<br><br>One theme: maintaining a brisk, engaging pace.<br><br>""If you can hear my voice, clap once,"" she says one recent morning as students settle into their desks after an activity.<br><br>""If you can hear my voice, clap twice.""<br><br>She sets a timer for three minutes, then picks up a soft red ball, which she tosses to students who raise their hands to share what they're writing about in their essays. The ball changes the mood a bit, she says. Students who usually hang back are drawn in.<br><br>""They want to catch the ball,"" she says.<br><br>Transitions between activities are swift, too. She gives students just 10 seconds to get from their seats to the classroom rug or vice versa. As they move, she counts out loud. ""10. 9. 8. 7 ... ""<br><br>Another theme: engaging their hearts as well as their heads.<br><br>She strives to get her students &#x2014; and their families &#x2014; invested in working hard at school. She talks with them about their hopes and dreams, and then works backward. What do they have to do in college to reach those goals? In high school? Today?<br><br>Earlier this year, Coxon handed out a sheet that showed her students how West Seattle Elementary's test scores compare with district and state averages. Many were surprised the scores were so low. To them, school was good if they liked their teacher. They hadn't realized they were so far behind.<br><br>""It makes me feel like slavery all over again,"" wrote one student, a girl named Rahwa.<br><br>""It makes me so mad, it makes me want to pull out my hair,"" wrote her classmate, Achara. ""But instead, I'll work hard and go to college.""<br><br>Coxon doesn't have as much time with her students as she did at her last school, a charter school where the day ran from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.<br><br>While she'd love that much time now, she's determined to succeed anyway.<br><br>""It just adds urgency to use every minute that I have,"" she said.<br><br>Finding the right teachers<br><br>All of the West Seattle Elementary staff members from last year could have stayed if they were willing to sign an agreement that they would work longer hours and face extra scrutiny &#x2014; including being judged in part by their students' test scores.<br><br>But they also could choose to transfer to other schools &#x2014; no harm, no foul. About half left.<br><br>The half who remained are relatively new to the school themselves. Only a handful had taught at West Seattle for more than a year.<br><br>The result was a chance for the struggling school to look at itself with fresh eyes.<br><br>The newly hired teachers mostly came from other states or districts, chosen in part because they've been successful in challenging schools before, said Erin Tillman, who was an administrator at West Seattle last year but opted to return to the classroom this fall.<br><br>Tillman said they also looked for people who were flexible enough to work closely with instructional coaches, consultants and their peers &#x2014; expectations that come with the grant.<br><br>The teachers and other staff members who opted to stay are strong, too, Tillman said.<br><br>""I've never worked with this caliber of people overall.""<br><br>The only first-year teacher among the new hires, Tara Slinden, says she feels like a freshman who somehow ended up on the varsity team.<br><br>She's working hard to keep up, she says, even placing a pad of Post-its by her bedside to jot down good ideas that come to her in the middle of the night. Not long ago, she wrote a whole lesson plan that way &#x2014; on 14 little yellow squares.<br><br>Sacco, the principal, was nearly the last staff member hired. Superintendent Maria Goodloe-Johnson said it took time to find someone who had led a similar school through big changes. Sacco drove here from Florida in August, her Toyota Camry packed tight.<br><br>Because she arrived so late, the whirlwind that always accompanies a new school year was even busier.<br><br>It will be so much easier next year,<br><br>is a frequent refrain among teachers and staff.<br><br>Already, the school feels different, teachers say. Hallways and the playground are much calmer than last year. And in the classroom, less time is spent on behavior, more on instruction.<br><br>That was one of the first tasks Sacco tackled. With help from staff, she thought through every procedure, from how students enter the building, to how many classes are in the cafeteria at any one time during lunch. The goal was to set consistent expectations to minimize problems.<br><br>Signs all through the hallways say ""Straight. Right. Quiet. Polite."" Shorthand for: Walk quietly and politely in a straight line, on the right-hand side of the wall.<br><br>With that in place, Sacco is now deep into working on instruction.<br><br>For West Seattle to reach its goals, ""you need top-quality instruction in the classroom,"" she said. ""That's the bottom line.""<br><br>They have a lot of work to do. Sacco says she's impressed with the skill teachers have and how fast they're improving, but that many students have a long way to go.<br><br>In a recent meeting, the staff wrote each student's name and reading and math level on Post-it notes, then arranged the notes by level on the wall. The bulk of students in each grade were at least one year behind where they should be.<br><br>The fifth-graders in particular were spread very wide &#x2014; all the way from kindergarten level up.<br><br>Climbing the mountain<br><br>Almost kitty-corner from her Stanford cap and gown, Coxon has taped up a big, butcher-paper tree beside a steep, brown mountain. The mountain represents the path to college. The tree is to track the students' climbs in reading.<br><br>Each time someone moves up a level, they celebrate.<br><br>One recent afternoon, those students were Anthony and Abdifatah.<br><br>Coxon leads the class through a finger drum roll as she announces their names. She asks Anthony which class cheer he'd like. Anthony picks the ""paparazzi."" Students pretend to snap a few pictures of him, then give him a thumbs up and a <br><br>""lookin' good!""<br><br>Coxon asks what advice he has to help his classmates improve, too. ""If I am bored, I just get a book and I read,"" he says.<br><br>Coxon emphasizes how much progress he's made, that they're all making.<br><br>Then it's time to head to the rug for a vocabulary lesson.<br><br>""10, 9.""

She's held truancy workshops for groups of parents and picked students up from home herself. She even dropped off food at the home of one family, thinking the kids there weren't coming to class because they were hungry.<br><br>With many families, her efforts worked. One mom was so intent on fulfilling her attendance contract that she called the police when her son refused to go to school.<br><br>Still, when Bermes, who is in her first year as a school counselor, looked at the latest numbers, her hopes of a fast truancy turnaround were dashed. Attendance hasn't improved, and neither has the high rate of unexcused absences, five times greater than the district average.<br><br>Principal Vicki Sacco told Bermes not to worry. The kind of overhaul the West Seattle school undertook this year takes time. And a lot has changed for the better, too, as West Seattle labors through its first year as part of a large, federally funded effort to turn around some of the nation's lowest-performing schools.<br><br>Seven months into the school year, the two-story brick school in West Seattle's High Point neighborhood is a much calmer place, with fewer fights and stricter rules. Test scores are up, especially in math, where the school's overall improvement from last spring to this winter was greater than at any other elementary in the city.<br><br>The results impressed the district's central office so much that interim Superintendent Susan Enfield showed up recently with two sheet cakes to celebrate.<br><br>Still, it's clear that West Seattle is just getting started in its struggle to attain what is still a rare distinction: becoming a high-achieving, high-poverty school.<br><br>Despite the test-score improvements, many students have a long way to go before their academic skills are where they should be. Sacco is always trying to find the best balance for keeping up the pace of improvement she'd like to see without pushing teachers too hard. The teaching is strong, Sacco says, but there's room for improvement &#x2014; even as the extra money that the federal grant provides is undercut by district budget cuts.<br><br>And nothing the school does will help if students miss class too often.<br><br>""If the kids aren't here, it doesn't matter what you do, they're not learning,"" Sacco said. ""They need to be here.""<br><br>Only 40 to 45 of the school's 398 students make up the bulk of the absences, Bermes says, but that's still too many.<br><br>One kindergartner, she said, has missed 68 days &#x2014; more than one-third of the school year.<br><br>A national effort<br><br>Nationwide, more than 100 schools were awarded similar federal turnaround grants last year, including two other schools in Seattle and 15 elsewhere in the state. Additional schools will get funds this year.<br><br>Many have a lot in common with West Seattle Elementary, including a large percentage of students who qualify for free- or reduced-price lunches and are learning English. Many at West Seattle are from families that have immigrated from East Africa and Latin American countries.<br><br>To win one of the grants &#x2014; which add $350,000 to $400,000 to West Seattle Elementary's budget each year for three years &#x2014; school districts must agree to significant changes. At West Seattle, that's meant a new principal, many new teachers, 15 extra minutes of school each day, more after-school activities &#x2014; and much more accountability, for students and parents as well as staff.<br><br>The Seattle Times has been following West Seattle's efforts this school year to see what they yield.<br><br>Improving the school's climate has been the biggest success so far.<br><br>That was Sacco's first major effort as the school's new leader, and many parents and students say West Seattle feels like a different place.<br><br>""We're able to learn more. The rules are working,"" said fifth-grader Arlondra Rivera, whose test scores have shot up this year from average to above average.<br><br>Last year ""you could get away with anything,"" said another fifth-grader. ""Even if you beat someone up, you could go on field trips.""<br><br>This year, he missed one excursion for forgetting his permission slip. And because he got into some trouble and hadn't finished all his homework, he almost missed another.<br><br>There isn't enough money in the federal grant to significantly extend the school day, which many believe has been one key to major gains in achievement at other high-poverty schools. So Sacco and her staff look for ways to make sure every minute counts.<br><br>One big focus: making clear to students what's expected and rewarding them for achieving it. Each teacher, for example, has a stack of ""Husky Bucks"" to give students for working hard, for kindness, for doing the right thing. The more Bucks students earn, the better chance they have of receiving a prize in a Husky Buck drawing held every few months. There also are awards for classes that behave best in the cafeteria, and those with the highest attendance rates.<br><br>Teachers such as Clarissa Resendez, a veteran who is considered one of the school's best, have their own incentive programs, too.<br><br>Goals and awareness<br><br>Each month, Resendez, who came to West Seattle this year from nearby Highland Park Elementary, sends her fifth-graders home with a ""goal"" sheet outlining behavior and academic expectations that both the student and parents sign. She tells students if they're below grade level &#x2014; which are often tough conversations, she says, but effective in giving some students the push they need to try harder. And four or five times a day, she has the kids rate their own behavior.<br><br>It doesn't take long. She just runs through the class list, asking each student how many points they think they deserve.<br><br>There is no punishment for losing points &#x2014; except not getting invited to a short, extra recess or getting a small treat at the end of each month. Mostly, Resendez says, the point system helps students reflect on how they're doing &#x2014; especially those who don't have a parent or other adult at home keeping close tabs on them. And it rewards the many students who quietly and regularly complete all their work.<br><br>If students try to give themselves more points than they deserve, they can be challenged, as Resendez did recently when one boy tried to slide by with a 49 out of 50.<br><br>""I really think it should be 45 or 44,"" Resendez said.<br><br>""Forty-six,"" the student said.<br><br>""Forty-five,"" Resendez insisted.<br><br>The rest of the class laughed.<br><br>Hope, talent and worry<br><br>Resendez and many other teachers started the year confident that the school's test scores would go up. They feel part of a talented team &#x2014; half made up of teachers who chose to stay at the school under the new conditions of the grant, and half from places as far away as New York City who wanted to be part of the challenge.<br><br>But they also feel a lot of pressure, which is rising as end-of-year tests get under way &#x2014; the last of the school year's Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) exams, which are mandated by the district, plus state tests in reading, math, writing and science.<br><br>Resendez and other teachers worry whether students are ready &#x2014; especially for the state test's multistep questions, which trip up a lot of them. Starting next year, test scores will become part of how the teachers are evaluated.<br><br>Resendez recently spent a full day on practice questions, showing students how many of them gave good answers on some questions yet wouldn't have earned any points because they didn't follow the instructions exactly.<br><br>But she and other teachers also are heartened by much of what they see.<br><br>Resendez, for example, says it's very rewarding to know how much improvement many of her students made this school year, even if about a third still won't reach a fifth-grade proficiency level by year's end. Ten of them already have gone up two grade levels in reading.<br><br>The other fifth-grade teacher, Tara Sliden, is happy to see that one of her students, who was identified as gifted a few years ago, now has test scores that reflect that.<br><br>And then there's the wavy-haired boy that Sliden meets with once a week at lunch, in an attempt to keep his up-and-down behavior on the ""up"" side.<br><br>At one recent meeting, she asked him a series of questions aimed at showing him he has the traits of a high achiever.<br><br>Does he think he has control over his life? Does he think others are supposed to make him happy?<br><br>He answered yes to the first, no to the second.<br><br>Does he learn from his mistakes?<br><br>""Umm,"" he said. ""Last year I didn't.""<br><br>""But this year?""<br><br>""Uh-huh.""<br><br>She asked whether he believes he's a high achiever, and he says he thinks everyone can be.<br><br>""Just don't think negative,"" he said. ""Negative gets you nowhere. ""Positive gets you better places.""<br><br>And Bermes, the counselor disappointed in attendance rates, proudly posted a chart about discipline on her door, in the halls and at the office. It shows that only half as many kids are being sent to the office for misbehaving this year &#x2014; down to an average of not even one per day.<br><br>""Just like anybody here, I want to see the change,"" she said.

When she sat down with teacher Tara Slinden, Slinden encouraged her to try for 12 more, so she'd hit grade level.<br><br>""Do you think you can do that?"" Slinden asked.<br><br>The girl nodded.<br><br>""I think you can. You're a tremendously talented reader now. Do you know that? Do you feel that? Do you believe that?""<br><br>And when test day arrived, some teachers pumped up their classes like coaches before a crucial game.<br><br>""You start strong, but you finish stronger,"" teacher Damian Joseph told his third-graders as they headed off to their last exam.<br><br>A tall man with a booming voice, Joseph has a way of inspiring his students to work harder. He knows the challenges some of them face because he, too, grew up poor. But he also knows they can do it, because he did.<br><br>All the way to the testing room, he kept the pep talk going.<br><br>""Let's do this,"" he said, as students lined up at the door. At the first corner in the hall: ""We don't back down."" At the top of the stairs: ""Everybody say it: 'Finish stronger.' ""<br><br>Not that it's all about testing. While Joseph and the other teachers want scores to go up, they also want to inspire students to love learning, to be good citizens.<br><br>That said, they concentrated heavily throughout the year on the tested subjects &#x2014; mostly reading and math. It wasn't until after the tests were behind them, with just a few weeks of school left, that Joseph started cursive writing and brought out one of the science experiments he'd felt were too time-consuming to do earlier.<br><br>Mixed results<br><br>For Joseph, the district math test went very well.<br><br>Three-quarters of his students hit the national average for third-graders at the end of the year. In reading, however, it didn't go quite as well.<br><br>About 30 minutes after that test started, the first student to finish stood up and walked up to Joseph. Because it's an online test, students learn their score right after the last question &#x2014; and she told him she earned a 199, point short of the national average.<br><br>Joseph didn't hide his disappointment. He felt she'd rushed and told her so. She frowned.<br><br>A boy finished next &#x2014; another student Joseph worried had gone too fast. But he earned a 212.<br><br>And so it continued over the next hour. Students who hit the 200 mark bounded up to Joseph with big smiles. Most of the others reported their results with long faces.<br><br>After the last student finished, Joseph quickly did a tally. Fifty-five percent scored 200 or more. Not bad, he said, but he had hoped for at least 60 percent.<br><br>Looking to next year<br><br>The other good news at year's end was that most of the teachers plan to return in the fall.<br><br>Only four are leaving &#x2014; and none, Sacco said, due to burnout or discontent.<br><br>Of those who are departing, Sacco dismissed one for poor performance. The art teacher also won't return because Sacco decided to replace school-day art lessons with science &#x2014; a sore point with some teachers but one Sacco said she made for a number of reasons, including the fact that she needs the art room for a classroom next year. She promises to continue art in other ways.<br><br>The others left for personal reasons, including Chrissie Coxon, now Chrissie Wright, who got married a few months ago and accepted a job as director of the children's ministry for her church, Mars Hill.<br><br>Back in September, fresh from a New Jersey charter school, she had dubbed her fourth-grade class the Stanford Class of 2023 to inspire students to think about college. Her year wasn't quite as good as she'd hoped. She got the results she wanted on one reading assessment &#x2014; a class average showing more than one year of growth &#x2014; but not on the MAP.<br><br>Sacco has already filled three of the four empty teaching positions, and is deep into planning for next fall. This year, she focused first on creating high expectations for learning and behavior. Next year, she'll go deeper into improving instruction.<br><br>As for the state report, Sacco still hasn't shared it with staff. She will &#x2014; but not just yet. For now it sits in her file drawer, where it will stay until fall. For morale's sake, she wanted the staff to end the year basking in the progress, not worried about all the work yet to come.<br><br>Linda Shaw: 206-464-2359 or <br><br>lshaw@seattletimes.com<br><br>","[{""tag"":""result"",""text"":""In grades 3 through 5, the students' gains on the district reading test were higher than at any other school in the district, a recent district analysis showed.
